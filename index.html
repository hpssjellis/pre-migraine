So I take very complex Machine Learning used to train robots and simplify it so that average High School students can understand it. That is what I do. 
Possibly Migraines are highly complex and not easy to solve, probably why there are so many snake oil type "cures" available which probably are a mix of
helpful with the placebo effect with darn right scams.<br><br>

This web site was started March 26th, 2021. Absolutely no bases in any Science, just my own thoughts after 27 years of migraine pain (Strangely correlated with the 
number of years I have been a parent). 

I have however had regular sugar induced headaches all my life. The difference is that regular headaches 
get some relief using Tylenol. For me Migraines have a distinct <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/prodrome">prodrome</a> a visual aura 20 minutes before pain and for which Tylenol has no effect.<br><br>

<a Name="background"></a> <h3> My Background</h3>

I do have a Chemistry Degree and worked as a trace substance Analytical Chemist, but what does that mean.<br>  
I have a teaching degree<br>
I also have a diploma in Counselling<br>
I have taught Science and Physics for many years.<br>
I also simplify Machine Learning and other complex Robotics and coding tasks for students<br>
I now teach Robotics, Coding, Animation and 3D Printing in BC, Canada<br>



About 20 years ago I used to make computer programs to monitor which foods correlated with my Migraines, but for the last
10 years I have just eaten a mainly meat and vegetables (typically high in Potassium) low salt diet, with minimal fruits such as : blueberries, melons, kiwi.
that has done fine at migraine prevention as long as I stick to it. Unfortunately sticking to my program means having very
little of the food listed below in the <a href="#RocksettaMigraineTesting"> Rocksetta Migraine Prevention Testing </a> which happen to be all the foods that taste good<br><br>
For the last 10 years I have basically had about a migraine every 2 weeks, since I can't just eat meat and vegetables.<br>

This is the part that is probably best to talk to your Doctor instead of taking advise from some hack on the internet.<br>
This webpage is about prevention, but if I do  get a migraine aura, I first try Angela Stantons
bit of salt under the tongue. If that works to reduce the aura, I have some salt in water, I then might have some creatine monohydrate in water, if that doesn't 
help reduce the aura, to prevent any pain I take my 25 mg 
co-sumatriptan under my tongue until it fully dissolves. It tastes terrible and I feel crappy for 24 hours, but at least I then have no pain.<br>

 <h5>Self saving chart</h5>
I used this concept before finding my <a href="#EocksettasLatestMigrainePrevention"> Latest Rocksetta Migraine Prevention Method</a><br><br>
The basic concept below is to set the sliders depending on how you feel you are for the three categories: Food, exercise, emotional. Then click the buttons below when you have one 
 of the substances that might cause migraines. Note: you can actually just drag the slider to whatever starting point you want. A cookie might be a small issue, whereas a full 
 plate of MSG containing Chineese food might be a large issue button to click.
 Then watch the line scale and wait until you are back in the green before having another "issue" food. Note The Level Reduction Rate, that basically says how long it is predicted 
 to take to reduce one level. Such as going from level red to blue would take that amount of time. It is effected by the sliders.

 <li> During the day eat normally and hydrate with occasional small amounts of salt
 <li> Normal dinner but have more red meat/salmon and salt.

 <h3><a name="RocksettaBasicTheory">Rocksetta Basic Migraine Prevention Theory</a> </h3>
 Probably all wrong, but I make decisions based on a theories<br><br>
 
 In the following GIF The green area shows many brain nutrients that have higher or lower concentrations in the green zone which is fine, whenever a 
 nutrient moves to the red zone their is a possiblity of a trigger firing a migraine. If many nutrients are in the red zone either too high or too low there 
 is an increased chance of having a trigger activate a migraine. The animation is much faster than what would happen in real life.<br>
 These Visualizations hopefully show the complexity of what might be happenning for Migraineurs in the hard to measure Intracellular fluids of Brain Cells. <br>
 Unlike the diabetic for which blood glucose monitors work well, we don't know if Blood, Sweat, Tears or Urine analysis gives an accurate measurement of what is happening for nutrients 
 inside brain cells.<br>

<ol>  
<li> Just like when the stomach is empty and the body needs nutrients we get mild discomfort, tummy rumblings then later uncomfortable hunger pains, 
 but when the mind needs nutrients, it causes prodromes (weird auras, tummy issues, etc look it up) and if the brain doesn't get those needed nutrients 
 it is primed to react to a migraine trigger: bright lights, powerful smells, emotional situations... causing the cascade effect of the pain of a migraine. 
<li> Migraineurs seem very sensitive to sugar balance, like a diabetic however with much more complex other nutrients in balance as well
<li> The brain needs a lot of oxygen, if you get a prodrome (aura etc) trying some deep breathing.
<li> Many modern chemicals and preservatives can effect the bodies ability to absorb the nutrients the brain needs
<li> Stess also probably effects the bodies ability to absorb or balance electrolytes/Creatine/Glucose
<li> Hydration helps flush some of these chemcials from your body over the course of a few days
<li> There are lots of needed electrolytes, but the brain is very sensitive to Sodium and Potassium balance, if you hydrate then you will need more of these electrolytes
<li> If you have a diet high in Potassium from foods you eat then (Care of Angela Stanton) the sodium balance can be achieved very quickly by putting salt under your tongue or drinking 1/8 teaspoon salt in water.      
<li> Red meats and salmon are high in Creatine which supplies energy and retains hydration for the brain and muscles. Possible Migraineurs have issues with low Creatine levels.
<li> Body builders often use 5 grams of Creatine Monohydrate daily, for some reason this massively improved my migraine prevention.  
<li> If 5 grams Creatine (or lots of salmon and red meats) works for you, then try to reduce it to 4 grams and see if that still helps.
<li> Also reduce your potassium foods intake and salt intake. The goal is to take only what is needed to prevent migraines.
<li> This goal may take me a few years to achieve, possibly there are more nutrients the brain needs
<li> I will test if during non stressful times any of this is needed and I just stick to meat and vegetable.
 <li> Perhaps only creatine, salt, potassium foods on the weekends

 So far this method seems to be doing well with the tests above.
 I will not know for sure if this method works fully until I start teaching school in September. Last year on startup, when I had to teach
